With  Whisper,  we  enable  our  users  to  communicate  from Peer to Peer by  using WebRTC technology. Since we are using Peer to Peer, they can send messages among themselves without a server intermediary, and we cannot access them even if we wanted to. We also encrypt these messages  symmetrically  as  an  extra  security  method. We  aim  to  offer  our  users  a  quality messaging and conversation service with a beautiful design. We are planning to add video chat feature and many more features in our next versions.

We are using:

- GIT hooks to increase version number before push it the the Github
- Github Actions as CI/CD tool to deploy our project to hositing
- Firebase hosting to serve our demo apps for every step of development


## Development

- We will use git feature branching strategy
  - We will open a branch for all new features and create pull request at the and of this feature's development
  - We will rebase commits to 1 commit for each pull request to keep main branch commit history

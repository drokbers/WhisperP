# whisperp

A new Flutter project.

### Our project will be live on every push on this link: https://whisperp.web.app

We are using:

- GIT hooks to increase version number before push it the the Github
- Github Actions as CI/CD tool to deploy our project to hositing
- Firebase hosting to serve our demo apps for every step of development

## Styles

  - We will open a branch for all new features and create pull request at the and of this feature's development
  - We will rebase commits to 1 commit for each pull request to keep main branch commit history
